JSLint integration for the Eclipse IDE
======================================

[JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/) is a popular tool to detect
errors and potential problems in JavaScript code.  This project integrates JSLint into
the Eclipse IDE.  It automatically validates \*.js files and adds warning markers for
every problem found by JSLint.

The JSLint eclipse plugin was forked from the 
[JSHint eclipse plugin](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jshint-eclipse) at commit dfa3c1da3c2d2e9c4c4c929fde14d2fe85b967d3 when support for jslint was removed.
